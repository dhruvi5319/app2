# State: Simple Weather App

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Answer "do I need an umbrella?" in under 3 seconds — current temperature and conditions visible above the fold with zero friction, no account, no ads.

**Current Focus:** Phase 3 — Layout & Details (in progress — 03-01 complete)

## Current Position

**Active Phase:** 3 — Layout & Details (in progress)
**Active Plan:** Plan 03-01 (complete)
**Status:** Phase 3 plan 1 complete — F5 responsive layout implemented
**Progress:** [████████░░] 82%

```
Phase 1: Foundation           ██████████  Complete (5/5 plans)
Phase 2: Forecasts & Visuals  ██████████  Complete (3/3 plans)
Phase 3: Layout & Details     ██░░░░░░░░  In progress (1/? plans)
Phase 4: Accessibility & Deployment ░░░░░░░░░░  Not started

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| `timezone=auto` on every Open-Meteo request | Without it, sunrise/sunset, hourly labels, and `isDay` break for non-local timezones — non-negotiable from Phase 1 |
| Integer-only temperature display | `Math.round()` applied in `transformForecastResponse()`, never in components |
| Skeleton components built in Phase 1 | Blank-screen prevention is a foundation concern, not a polish concern |
| Geolocation opt-in, never a gate | GPS denial must never produce a blank screen; city search is always primary |
| TanStack Query `staleTime: 10 minutes` | Rate limit protection + prevents redundant fetches |
| Vite 5 instead of Vite 8 | Node 18 constraint (v18.20.4); functionally equivalent for this project |
| No backend for v1 | All state in component-local state, TanStack Query cache, and `localStorage` |
| `precipitationProbability` from `daily.precipitation_probability_max[0]` | Open-Meteo's `current` block has no precip probability field — must source from daily[0] |
| `useReverseGeocode` uses `retry: false` | GPS-triggered reverse geocode calls should not auto-retry — user action is fleeting |
| `onMouseDown preventDefault` on dropdown items | Prevents input blur-before-select race condition in combobox autocomplete |
| `setTimeout 150ms` on input `onBlur` | Allows dropdown mousedown to fire before the dropdown closes on input blur |
| `useId()` for ARIA controls in SearchBar | Generates stable, unique IDs per component instance for correct combobox `aria-controls` → listbox association |
| HeroSection UnitToggle rendered outside conditional blocks | Ensures toggle visible in ALL 4 states (empty/loading/error/data) per FRD §F1 requirement |
| ConditionDisplay always pairs icon + label | Satisfies WCAG 1.4.1 — weather condition never conveyed by colour/icon alone; label always in adjacent span |
| App.tsx owns activeLocation state (LocationResult \| null) | Single source of truth passed as prop to HeroSection; SearchBar callback propagates upward |
| aria-live announcer is a persistent DOM element updated via ref | Per TechArch §11: never re-render live content, use requestAnimationFrame double-tap to ensure screen reader fires |
| WeatherIcon accepts weatherCode + isDay props (not icon string) | Component resolves icon filename internally from weatherCode+isDay — components pass raw forecast data, not pre-computed icon strings |
| HourlyCard isFirst prop for "Now" label | First card shows "Now" to orient the user to the current hour; all others use formatHour(time, timezone) |
| Daily forecast always uses isDay=true for WeatherIcon | FRD §F4 and TechArch §8 mandate daytime icons for all daily forecast rows regardless of current time |
| sr-only table always in DOM alongside Recharts chart | Proactive screen-reader accessibility; ChartErrorBoundary adds visible fallback on Recharts failures as a separate layer |
| App.tsx WeatherApp inner component pattern | AppErrorBoundary wraps outer App(); inner WeatherApp() has hooks access — clean separation of error boundary and component logic |
| useWeatherData in both App and HeroSection | TanStack Query deduplicates by query key — zero extra requests; both consumers get same cached data |
| 18 WMO icons (not 19 as plan text stated) | Plan file list had 18 entries matching WMO_CODE_MAP exactly — text was a counting error |
| `lg:grid lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-6` for daily+chart layout | Cleaner equal-width columns than flex approach; matches plan spec exactly |
| `@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu` installed alongside musl variant | Environment is glibc-based; musl native binding was installed by npm but can't load without musl libc |

### Critical Risks to Watch

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Timezone display bugs | `timezone=auto` + `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with explicit `timeZone` from `LocationResult` — never browser local timezone |
| Blank screens | TanStack Query `isLoading`/`isError` + skeleton components must be in Phase 1 |
| Decimal temperatures | `Math.round()` enforced in transformation layer, verified before Phase 2 |
| Recharts inaccessible to screen readers | Verify ARIA support in Phase 2; `<table>` fallback via `ChartErrorBoundary` if insufficient |
| WCAG contrast on dynamic gradients | Full gradient palette designed and contrast-verified in Phase 2 before ship |

### Phase Boundary Notes

- **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: `WeatherData` TypeScript interfaces must be stable before Phase 2 (hourly/daily components depend on them)
- **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: All 3 API services (`weatherApi.ts`, `geocodingApi.ts`, `nominatimApi.ts`) must be complete before Phase 3 polish begins
- **Phase 3 → Phase 4**: Responsive layout tested at all breakpoints before accessibility audit; can't audit what's still shifting

### TODOs / Flags

- [ ] Verify Recharts ARIA support when Phase 2 begins — may need `<table>` fallback from the start
- [ ] Bundle size check after Phase 2 (Recharts is the largest dependency; target < 300 KB gzipped)
- [ ] Update Nominatim `User-Agent` header with actual Vercel deploy URL before Phase 4 ship

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-06-10T20:31:53.817Z
**Stopped at:** Completed 03-01-PLAN.md
**Next action:** Phase 3 plan 01 complete — continue Phase 3 next plan or verify with `/pivota_spec-verify-work 03-layout-details`

**To resume:** Read this file first, then `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase structure, then `03-01-SUMMARY.md` for Phase 3 plan 1 context.
